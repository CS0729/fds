The whole project is included in the "project1end.c" file.（Because I think the project isn't too big.）
You can open it through DEVC or VSCODE.
!!!Remember to read the comments first in "project1end" so that you can follow the instructions to edit the code to successfuuly do your test.
'project1实验报告' shows the algorithm I use and thoughts that I have.It also contains the test data and my analysis.
Hope you a nice day!～
